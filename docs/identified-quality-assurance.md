Below are the currently identified QA that sstan identifies. If you would like to check out a list of patterns that are ready to be implemented and you would like to add them to the repo, you can check out the [Contribution.md](https://github.com/0xKitsune/sstan/blob/main/docs/Contributing.md#potential-optimizations-vulnerability-and-qa-additions)!

| Quality Assurance         | Description                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| constructor_order         | Constructor must be placed before any other function |
| private_func_leading_underscore | Use leading underscore for private functions |
| private_vars_leading_underscore | Use leading underscore for private variables |
| constant_immutable_namespace | Constant and immutable variable names should be in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE |
| constructor_var_initialization | Constructor should check that all parameters are not 0 |
| contract_name_pascal_case | Contract names should be in PascalCase |
